# Hi there! 👋 I'm Harshith Mente ✨

I'm a passionate MERN Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer, constantly exploring new ways to implement technology into our lives.

# 🔭 What I Do
I specialize in building robust and scalable web applications using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I am experienced in building RESTful APIs and have a deep understanding of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also proficient in UI/UX design, using tools such as Adobe XD, Figma, and Sketch to create beautiful and functional designs.

# 🚀 My Passion

I am an enthusiastic and dedicated developer, always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. I love to code and create websites and applications that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also efficient and effective.

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the README with circular icons randomly clustered for a more visually appealing look:
